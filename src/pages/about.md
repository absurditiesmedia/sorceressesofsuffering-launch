You've arrived at our corner of the web. :vomits in mouth:. Who let you in here? Gross. Well you're here. Gawking at us like the disgusting letcher that you are. Do you ever walk down the street and notice women looking away as you pass them? Or staring in disgust? We imagine that's probably the case. You probably think you're hot shit. Well you're not. You're just as much a part of the patriarchy as any "man" and we use that term lightly. There are not many of your sex worthy of the title. 1% at best. And that's a highly optimistic statistic. We've been around long enough to know. Interacted with enough of you at work and in social circles. "Entitled" is a term we would use to describe the most of you. It's a social disease and you have it. "Not all men?" yeah, we're sure you're more quick to jump to the defense of you kind with comments like that much sooner than you'd ever hold one another accountable for your disgusting misogynistic attitudes. Get a fucking life. Try to find a way to stop being part of the problem.

You're a fucking joke. Look at yourself. That's right. We're laughing at you. Tiny little man, you really think you're something don't you? Nice
car, job, bank accounts, but nothing of substance to offer the world.
You command a tiny empire of shit. Nothing you've done in life is
impressive. You've wasted it chasing your meaningless career. What of
actual cultural value have you even created? You've never even known
real intimacy. You're a fucking joke, you're part of the problem.
Disgusting filth. Your only hope of redemtion is to send as much of your
wealth as possible to us, so we can use it for something worthwhile.
Things that might have an affect on the course of history. We have real
ideas that will affect actual social change. You? Pfft. lol.<br/>

What you find here is just a sample. If you want more you'll send money. There's so much more to see. Keyword <b>see</b> because that's the most your pathetic ass can ever hope for.
